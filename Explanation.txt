Explanation: 
This is the build for the scripting unity exercise of Lab2, Interactive Systems. 

I have implemented both parts of the scripting exercise (although only the first one was mandatory).
I have solved an issue with the counter of the sheeps. 
When a sheep fell down, it counted 2 instead of 1. I guessed this was because the method was called 
twice, but have been unable to see where. Instead, I have solved this by adding a counter private variable to the script and adding one only when the variable was even. 

The knowledge we need to play the game is: 
- When opened, there is a title. If you press "play", the game starts. If you press "quit", the window is closed
- Before playing the game you can press the hay machine to choose the color.
- When entering play mode, you can move the hay machine with the arrows, and create a hay bale with the space. There will be coming sheeps and the main objective is to kill the sheeps with the hale bales. If three sheeps fall down, you loose.
